## Platform
Python 3.7  
Pytorch >=0.4.1  

## Analysis metrics

In "analysis_metrics_in_paper", seven metrics are included which were utilized in our paper.


## Fusion framework

[MS-COCO 2014](http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/train2014.zip) (T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollar, and C. L. Zitnick. Microsoft coco: Common objects in context. In ECCV, 2014. 3-5.) is utilized to train our auto-encoder network.

## Fusion strategy (two attention models)  
In our fusion strategy, we focus on two types of features: spatial attention model and channel attention model. The extracted multi-scale deep features are processed in two phases.

## NestFuse for RGBT visual object tracking
In this experiment, we choose SiamRPN++ \cite{li2019siamrpn++} as the base tracker and the fusion strategy proposed in this paper is applied to do the feature-level fusion. The SiamRPN++ is based on deep learning and achieves the state-of-the-art tracking performance in 2019.
